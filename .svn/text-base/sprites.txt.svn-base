Shishi ("Lion") Sprite Manager

Main window
-----------
File menu:
  Open ISO... - Open a PSX or PSP ISO 
    SPECIAL NOTES:
      PSX: When you open a brand new PSX ISO, the program will ask if you want
        to restructure the ISO. You must select "OK" to continue. This will
        rearrange the contents of the ISO so that you can use 65536 bytes
        for every sprite and allow you to use a unique spritesheet for all
        0x99 sprites
      PSP: Restructuring is not possible. Multiple spritesheets "overlap". 
        The program will print a warning at the bottom of the window when
        you are viewing a sprite that overlaps with another one. The max SPR
        file size will be printed in the top right area of the window.
    
SPR menu:
  Import SPR: Import a SPR on top of the current sprite. This will modify the
    ISO immediately
  Export SPR: Export a SPR of the current sprite
  Import BMP: Import a BMP on top of the current sprite. This bitmap can be
    any height, but must be 256 pixels wide. The program will copy each row 
    of pixels on top of the current sprite. This will modify the ISO
    immediately
  Export BMP: Export a BMP of the current sprite for editing in your image
    editor
    
SP2 menu:
  Import or export a SP2 file of the current sprite

*.SPR files:
  These contain 16 16-color palettes and an image that is 256 pixels wide, with
  variable height.
  Some of the data in the SPR file is compressed. The program should detect it and 
  decompress it. When you save it will compress what it needs to automatically.
*.SP2 files:
  These contain an image that is 256x256 pixels, with no palette. The game will
  use the palette in the SPR file that is associated with each SP2 file.
  Ex. MOL.SPR's palette will be used for MOL2.SP2

Always use corresponding palette for portrait:
  Shows the portrait onscreen with the correct palette. For instance, if the
  currently-selected palette is "Sprite #2", the palette "Portrait #2" will be 
  used to display the portrait.
  THIS IS A "DISPLAY ONLY" SETTING. IT DOES NOT AFFECT THE FILES OUTPUT BY 
  THE PROGRAM.
  
Thanks to Gemini on the ROMHacking forums for disassembling the decompression
algorithm. 
Thanks to the Q-Gears team (http://q-gears.sourceforge.net/) for
their help deciphering some of the SHP files.
Thanks to mes for decoding the .SEQ file format
