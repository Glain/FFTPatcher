In FFTPatcher, you can select "Generate Resources.zip".
This will create a zip file that you can edit.
Place the zip file in the same directory as PatcherLib.Resources.dll

Edit the XML files in the zip file in order to change the TEXT
that is displayed in FFTPatcher, FFTacText, and 
Shishi Sprite Editor.

THIS DOES NOT AFFECT THE TEXT THAT IS DISPLAYED IN THE GAME.
