How to get started
------------------
From the ISO menu, import a PSP or PSX ISO.
PSX ISOs should be unmodified Mode2/2352 images.
PSP ISOs should be unmodified Mode1/2048 images. The European and US versions
are supported. You can rip a PSP ISO using custom firmware.

Editing text
------------
Edit each entry in the grid. Some special codes allowed:
{Color XX} - Changes the text to a certain color. XX must be 00-FF (uppercase)
{Delay XX} - Changes the delay that is used after each character of text.
             If you want text to be slow, set this very high.
             XX must be 00-FF (uppercase)
{Tab XX} - PSP only. Moves the text output to a certain tab-stop on the screen
{Serpentarius} - The Serpentarius Zodiac symbol
{Ramza} - The main character's name
{SP} - A special space character. If you see it, you probably shouldn't change it.
{SP2} - A special space character. If you see it, you probably shouldn't change it.
{0xE1} - Sometimes you'll see something like "Allow {0xE1} to join your party?"
         The game will substitute the unit's name (or whatever) where it says {0xE1}
{0xXX}     - You can insert your own custom binary data into the text stream.
{0xXXXX}     1, 2, or 3 bytes are allowed
{0xXXXXXX}   This probably shouldn't be used.
{Newline} - Inserts a new line.

The program uses the "Arial Unicode MS" font. If you don't have it, you should
get it (somehow...)

What is DTE?
------------
DTE means dual-tile encoding. It's a method of storing text in the 
game so that ONE BYTE can represent MORE THAN ONE CHARACTER.
For example, you might analyze the text and see that a comma (",") is
usually followed by a space (" "). So if you combine both characters
into one byte (", "), you can save space. Note that after you do this, 
it is still possible to have a comma "," or space " " alone.

How does FFTacText do DTE?
---------------------------
First, it goes through all the files and checks to see if they are
too large.
If it finds files that are too big, it sorts them based on which
file is "too big"-est.
Then, starting with the biggest file, it analyzes the text for
common pairs of letters, performing replacements and keeping a list
of what strings map to what DTE byte. Once the first file is done,
it checks to see if the rest of the files can be compressed using
the information retrieved from the first file. If not, it analyzes
the second file, etc.
There are only about 100 bytes available to use for encoding text pairs.
If FFTacText runs out of pairs, it will give up and give you an error.

Can I open .ffttext files from the old version?
-----------------------------------------------
No.

Can I edit .ffttext files in a text editor?
------------------------------------------
Yes. Make sure to save as UTF-8 and do not remove any <Entry> elements.

What is QuickEdit?
------------------
It's a way to make changes to several files at once.
There are ten categories in QuickEdit:
  Item Names
  Item Descriptions
  Ability Names
  Ability Descriptions
  Skillset Names
  Skillset Descriptions
  Job Names
  Job Descriptions
  Job Requirements
  Spell Quotes (not in PSP)
Once you change something in QuickEdit, the change is applied to every
file in the game that contains that information.

What does the Restore button do?
--------------------------------
It rereads a specific file off of your ISO. 

Problems
--------
Problem: Diagonal lines show up through the text
Solution: This usually happens of a line of text is too "wide" to fit on screen.
          Try adding some {Newline} to the text.

P: The screen flashes and then all my text gets replaced with katakana and kanji
S: This usually happens of a line of text is too "wide" to fit on screen.
   Try adding some {Newline} to the text.

P: Dismiss quotes are messed up in battle
S: Still trying to fix this

P: On the PSP, the character portrait shows up on top of the Personae text
S: Some {SP2} bytes got removed. Try using the "Restore" button on WLDMES.BIN

P: I'm stuck inside the editing grid.
S: There's something wrong with your text. 
   Make sure that all { are matched with }
   Make sure you aren't using an illegal character.
   A message will show up below the grid that tells you where it found
   the error while processing.
   
Help needed:
    - Tell me about any visual anomalies that appear in-game after using the program
      Include as many of the following things as possible:
        A memory card with a save RIGHT BEFORE the problem happens
        A savestate RIGHT BEFORE the problem happens
        Your .ffttext file
        A screenshot of the problem
        Instructions on how to make the problem occur after loading the save/savestate
      
Thanks to:
  Gomtuu: His page helped me understand the text compression algorithm and how
    the double-byte characters were processed. http://gomtuu.org/fft/
  Zodiac: Got me started with a list of text locations in the Playstation version.
  Phoenix (SadNES cITy): Explained how sadNES implemented DTE in the Italian 
    translation. Gave me the asm used for graphical DTE on PSX.
