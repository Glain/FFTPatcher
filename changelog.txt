  Reworked how PSP ISOs are handled internally
  Fixed handling of "Partitioned" and fixed-length files in FFTacText

      SPRITE MANAGER WILL BE IMMEDIATELY APPLIED TO THE ISO
    When opening a freshly-ripped PSX ISO, it will ask you to restructure.
      You must select Yes to continue. This will allow you to use all 0x99
      sprite slots
    Added an animation viewer - thanks to mes on #ffh for decoding the .SEQ
      file format
    Added ability to modify the SHP and SEQ files the game will use to 
      draw the sprite
    Added ability to modify other unknown flags for each sprite
  Fixed bug in FFTPatcher where changing a value causes the listbox to change
    position
  Added ability animations tab to FFTPatcher
  Added tutorial text to text editor
  Text editor: Fix DTE handling on PSX audio books
  FFTPatcher: added gameshark code generation for animations, move/find items, 
    shop inventories
  Fixed ICON0.PNG functionality when patching a PSP ISO 
  Added ability to generate a "Resources.zip" file. You can edit the contents
    of this file if you want to change what FFTPatcher/other programs
    consider to be the "default" values (or text display)
  Unused text sections are automatically hidden in FFTacText
    
Changes since v0.352:
  Added Store Inventories to FFTPatcher
  Removed Font from FFTPatcher
  Split shared information into PatcherLib and PatcherLib.Resources
  Rewrote text editor
  Added FFTorgASM - Lets you organize and apply custom patches
                    to the PSX ISO. See Example.xml
  
Changes since v0.328:
  Fixed bug that caused Ability Effects to be applied to the ISO incorrectly
  Fixed Formula 0x4E: Dmg_(MA*Y)
  Fixed bug that caused the Upper Level flag to not be updated on screen 
    properly in the ENTD unit editor
  
  Rewrite of Sprite Manager. Now, it reads all character/monster sprites from 
    an ISO file. Make your changes and save as a .shishi file or patch
    the ISO directly.
    
    *Not supported yet:
      WEP.SPR, OTHER.SPR 
      Changing "type" of sprite (Making AGURI be TYPE2 instead of TYPE1, etc)
      WLDFACE.BIN, EVTFACE.BIN, EVTCHR.BIN, UNIT.BIN
    
    Known bug: The thumbnail images in the main window look ugly...

  FFTacText won't work with this version. If you want to use
  it, download an old version and copy it to another directory.

Changes since v0.271:
  Added ability to convert a PSX fftpatch file to a PSP fftpatch file. 
    (NOTE: The new PSP abilities for Balthier and Dark Knight are overwritten
     during this process)

    what parts you want to patch.

    when you load your game from memory stick)

  Added asterisks * to changed items in each screen
  Added "upper level" flag to ENTD units
  Added ability to edit the "Move-Find Items" and traps on maps
  Added ability to "Clone" and "Paste" certain objects 
    (ex. Right click "Cure 2" on the left side of Abilities and paste it on top of 
     "Cure 3" and it will copy all the data from Cure 2 to Cure 3)
    (There is a cosmetic bug with this feature, the destination for the paste will not
     have the correct "blue highlighting" for changes until you select another ability
     and come back)
  Changed the .fftpatch file format. You can still open old files, but once you save
    them again you can only open them with new versions of FFTPatcher.

  The file ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll must be in the same directory as FFTPatcher.exe
  Removed:

    Patch BATTLE.BIN (Use Patch ISO instead)
    Open modified SCUS_942.21 (Use open modified ISO instead)

  FFTacText and ShishiSpriteEditor won't work with this version. If you want to use

    getting highlighted.

    (not everything is fixed yet)

      location on the disc, and it is not editable yet
  Refactored the ENTD editor based on feedback from the auritech forums
  Compressed some of the internal XML and binary files to shrink the file size
  ComboBoxes now "autocomplete", so if you tab to a ComboBox and type 
    "w-a-t-e-r" it will take you to "Water Anima". If you then type "w" it 
    will take you to "Waterwalking"
  All editing controls now have a "Reset" feature. Tab to a control and push 
    F12 to revert the value to its default

    that has the same Name as something else, it will select the other item 
    instead

    A control will be highlighted in blue if the value it modifies has been 
    changed from its default MouseOver on an editing control (except 
    checkboxes) will show a tooltip with the default value
