  <Patch name="Truth uses Faith" author="Raijinili">
    <Description>Rafa's Truth spells are affected by Faith.

Note: This is an evil hack: We jump from Truth damage calculation into the Faith damage spell calculation. A future version of this patch should overwrite the Faith damage spell calculation with itself, so that it will be detected as a conflict.</Description>
